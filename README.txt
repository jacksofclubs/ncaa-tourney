Participants draft teams and compete against each other.  Input as many participants and teams as you want.  Select which eight participants will be competing against each other.  Participants choose teams in the draft - these will be their teams for the duration of the tournament.  As the tournament progresses, participants will be awarded points when their teams win.  The one who has the most points at the end of the tournament will be the winner.
